# 1.1.8 Procedures as Black-Box Abstrations

There's some good take aways here in this section from a programming and syntactical perspective.

The general idea is that procedures (methods, functions, etc), how ever they are broken up, may be used without the concern of how it was implemented.

We can treat the procedure output, as described by name or by word, as truth and works as intended. Until proven otherwise.
This section also goes over method and variable scope. Going over the basic "define" that we've seen leading up to this point.
We are then introduced to the concept of internal defintions of a procedure and block structure.
Definitely introducing the idea of a class or complex function at this point.
